  <h3> The Beginning... </h3>
  <p> Beginning of my First Project. Will continue to update this as I learn the tools of Git and GitHub! This project will showcase some of the skills I learned through Maven, Spring, Java, and PostgreSQL to build an Expense Management API. It is my first and technically "beginner" project, but I hope to develop a deeper understanding through this self-learning experience. Enjoy! </p>
